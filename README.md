# citibike_analysis_2018


The Tableau workbook is saved as 2018_Citi_Bike_Analysis_Dashboard.twbx and the data used for this workbook came from 2018 Citi Bike csv files. Due to Tableau Public restrictions on importing a large dataset, I combined the csv files and randomly selected a sample of 500,000 to for analysis.
